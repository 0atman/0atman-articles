    <p>It's been a month since I started waking up at 3ammarginfigure &quot;everyman&quot; &quot;https://i.imgur.com/xVVXNAf.png&quot; &quot;My Everyman 2 Schedule.&quot; %} and taking two naps during the day, as detailed in <a href="/articles/20/sleep-experiment">my previous post</a> in this series.</p>
<p>I'm still keeping up my practice. I'm still overjoyed at the extra day's-worth of free time it gives me, early in the morning, when there is nothing pressing to do. This time is truly my own.</p>
<p>Though I have moments of tiredness now and then, they're diminishing every day, and it was a very small price to pay for getting 5 hours of productive time in the morning before I have to start work. For example, last Thursday, I arranged a cover of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1meeqQRR28">Tangerine Dream's <em>Love On A Real Train</em></a>, and published it to YouTube the next day, all work done before sunrise:

<h2 id="10-04-20">10/04/20</h2>
<p>I woke up at 3:00 and hit Everyman 2 cold turkey. I didn't prepare in advance, other than setting a silent alarm on my watch. My routine is to get up, shower, and sit in front of my computer. During this first weekend, I knew I'd need to have strategies to keep myself awake, so I mostly played video gamessidenote 'fo76' &quot;Fallout 76, mostly.&quot; %} during this time. I think this worked well, as it didn't require much brainpower (which I was lacking in the first weekend), but kept me awake through the adaptation period.</p>
<h2 id="14-04-20">14/04/20</h2>
<p>First day at work after the long weekend's adaptation. I had no problem getting back to it. My tiredness was now much reduced, and I was in no danger of falling asleep while working! (I have never fallen asleep during times I'd not scheduled a nap, though I occasionally nap for an extra 10 minutes).</p>
<p>My first nap at 7:00 and second at 13:00 fits well into my work schedule. The first doesn't affect my 8am start time, and the second I take during my lunchbreak.</p>
<p>Everyman 2 is flexible enough that I've moved my afternoon nap +/- 1h without much difficulty. I do note that I feel a little tiredness the next day if I move it a lot.</p>
<h2 id="20-04-20">20/04/20</h2>
<p>2 weeks in, I feel 90%sidenote 'ish' &quot;Or thereabouts.&quot; %} adapted, and have survived missing a nap, poor sleep quality due to sickness, and the constant clamour of people telling me that this is a bad idea. Nothing can persuade me to go back now, but I'm confident that if I need to break routine (say, for a holiday), I can easily pick it up again.

<h2 id="10-05-20">10/05/20</h2>
<p>That brings us to today. I feel 95% adapted, and slowly, day by day, asymptotically approaching 100%. </p>

<h2 id="insomnia">Insomnia</h2>
<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="/articles/20/sleep-experiment">previous post</a>, I used to have insomnia. I'd be in bed before 23:00, but not asleep before 1:00. As I hoped, the upheaval of Everyman 2 has cured me of this. I'm really good at sleeping now!</p>
<h2 id="bedtime-strictness">Bedtime Strictness</h2>
<p>The other side of the <em>being-cured-of-insomnia</em> coin is that I'm VERY tired at the end of the day: After 21:30 I'm falling asleep, and am ready to drop at 22:00.</p>
<p>While I understand this is quite normal for early-birds, it's a novel experience for me!</p>
<h2 id="social-life-impact">Social Life Impact</h2>
<p>My tiredness at the end of the day means that I'm keen to wind up social gatherings before 22:00. Though this isn't much different to how I was before, I'm now completely disciplined about logging off at 22:00.</p>
<h2 id="partner-impact">Partner Impact?</h2>
<p>Lucy's been very accommodating to my new schedule. I built my timetable to suit her, to minimise disruption. This is easy, as she sleeps soundly, I often don't wake her when getting up at 3:00.</p>
<h2 id="health-changes">Health Changes</h2>
<p>As with many Polyphasic experiments, I've found that my caffeine and calorie consumption has gone up dramatically. These two tools are very useful for waking yourself up in the adaptation period. I am now making a conscious effort to cut both down to the previous norms, as would be more healthy. I've gained about 3KG, and it'll be difficult to lose that. However, assuming I can get that under control, it'll have been a worthwhile step.</p>
<br/>

<h2 id="well-meaning-friends-family">Well-Meaning Friends &amp; Family</h2>
<p>Many things have surprised me during this experiment. The biggest one has been that about half the people I talk to ABSOLUTELY HATE it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I don't think it is a good idea. In fact, it might be construed as heuristic to the point of being selfish&quot;sidenote 'dad' &quot;Oatpa&quot; %}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very typical attitude. Sleep is a topic similar to diet and exercise - everyone has an opinion because we're all familiar with the subject matter.</p>
<p>My advice is to experiment quietly, telling only those around you that you need to nap during the day. You'll either succeed or fail, and both will be a valuable learning experience. You can then confidently <em>come out</em> in a big way!sidenote 'comeout' &quot;By writing the longest blog post of your life, for instance.&quot; %} I'm reminded of one of the rules of the Cult Of Donesidenote 'cod' &quot;<a href="https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13">https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13</a>&quot; %} that states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those without dirty hands are wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="things-that-helped-me-during-adaptation">Things That Helped Me During Adaptation</h2>
<p>Pick your schedule (Everymansidenote 'everypoly' &quot;<a href="https://polyphasic.net/schedules/everyman/">polyphasic.net/schedules/everyman/</a>&quot; %} works well, with 3 different options to suit your schedule).</p>
<p>Listening to brown noise while napping, if you are a light sleepersidenote 'brown' &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6MemVxEquE&amp;t=31825s">This one</a> is my favourite. Mmm, brown flavour.&quot; %}.</p>
<p>Start on a weekend you can isolate yourself from obligations.</p>
<p>Programme some low-effort distractions for the first few days, and don't worry that you're not productive; that'll come.</p>
<p>Don't eat breakfast at night. I found after a week of NEEDING to eat to stay awake, I preferred to wait until after my first nap to have breakfast. My digestion seemed slow and uncomfortable at nightsidenote 'circadian' &quot;Something something circadian rhythm.&quot; %}.</p>
<p>I found that having meals after each nap (breakfast and lunch, respectively), washing my face, and having a drink of water, really helped me bounce back into wakefulness. </p>
<p>If you are able to get blackout curtains or blinds for your bedroom, that's a great way of helping you nap.</p>
