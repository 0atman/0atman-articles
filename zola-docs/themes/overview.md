Themes are collections of layouts and styles used to facilitate the creation and management of Zola projects. As such, themes are Zola projects which provide their own templates, content and even static assets. 

Zola has built-in support for themes which makes it easy to customise and update them. 

All themes can use the full power of Zola, from shortcodes to Sass compilation.

A list of themes is available [here](@/themes/_index.md).
