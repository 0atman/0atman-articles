### NixOS / Nixpkgs

Zola is [available](https://search.nixos.org/packages?show=zola&query=zola)
in the nixpkgs repository. If you're using NixOS, you can install Zola
by adding the following to `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`:

```
environment.systemPackages = [
  pkgs.zola
];
```

If you're using Nix as a package manager in another OS, you can install it using:

```
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.zola
```

### Via Github Actions

Zola can be installed in a GHA workflow with [taiki-e/install-action](https://github.com/taiki-e/install-action).
Simply add it in your CI config, for example:

```yaml
jobs:
  foo:
    steps:
      - uses: taiki-e/install-action@v2
        with:
          tool: zola@0.17.1
      # ...
```

See the action repo for docs and more examples.

### Docker

Zola is available on [the GitHub registry](https://github.com/getzola/zola/pkgs/container/zola).
It has no `latest` tag, you will need to specify a [specific version to pull](https://github.com/getzola/zola/pkgs/container/zola/versions).

```sh
$ docker pull ghcr.io/getzola/zola:v0.17.1
```

#### Build

```sh
$ docker run -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v $PWD:/app --workdir /app ghcr.io/getzola/zola:v0.17.1 build
```

#### Serve

```sh
$ docker run -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v $PWD:/app --workdir /app -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/getzola/zola:v0.17.1 serve --interface 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --base-url localhost
```

You can now browse http://localhost:8080.

> To enable live browser reload, you may have to bind to port 1024. Zola searches for an open
> port between 1024 and 9000 for live reload. The new docker command would be
> `$ docker run -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v $PWD:/app --workdir /app -p 8080:8080 -p 1024:1024 ghcr.io/getzola/zola:v0.17.1 serve --interface 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --base-url localhost`

#### Multi-stage build

Since there is no shell in the Zola docker image, if you want to use it from inside a Dockerfile, you have to use the
exec form of `RUN`, like:

```Dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/getzola/zola:v0.17.1 as zola

COPY . /project
WORKDIR /project
RUN ["zola", "build"]
```


## Windows

Zola could be installed using official Winget command:

```sh
$ winget install getzola.zola
```

Also it is available on [Scoop](https://scoop.sh):

```sh
$ scoop install zola
```

and [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/):

```sh
$ choco install zola
```

Zola does not work in PowerShell ISE.

## From source
To build Zola from source, you will need to have Git, [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
installed.

From a terminal, you can now run the following commands:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/getzola/zola.git
$ cd zola
$ cargo install --path . --locked
$ zola --version
```

If you encountered compilation errors like `error: failed to run custom build command for 'ring v0.16.20'`, you can try the command below instead:

```sh
$ cargo build --release --locked --no-default-features --features=native-tls
```

The binary will be available in the `target/release` directory. You can move it in your `$PATH` to have the
`zola` command available globally:

```sh
$ cp target/release/zola ~/.cargo/bin/zola
```

or in a directory if you want for example to have the binary in the same repository as the site.
