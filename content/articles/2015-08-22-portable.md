My plan is to connect [this monitor](http://www.amazon.com/AOC-E1649FWU-USB-Powered-Portable-Monitor/dp/B005SEZR0G/ref=sr_1_1/182-8953425-3346443?ie=UTF8&qid=1440360553&sr=8-1&keywords=usb+monitors):

![USB Monitor](http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B005SEZR0G&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=geblbyjo-20)

To the Pi, and then both to a large battery pack via [this power meter](http://www.amazon.co.uk/DROK-Multimeter-Charging-Detector-Alignment-Red-Blue/dp/B00J4H5I3E%3Fpsc%3D1%26SubscriptionId%3DAKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q%26tag%3Dduc08-21%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00J4H5I3E) for calibration.

Based on the Pi's draw of about 2W, and the monitor's draw of about 1W, I think (at 5V) that an 11Ah battery could power them for 18h.

This is worth investigating, watch this space!
