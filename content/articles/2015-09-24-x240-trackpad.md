TrackPoint scrolling doesn't work out of box, but you can easily fix it by yourself.

1) Add `psmouse.proto=bare` option to you kernel during boot

2) Modify `/etc/default/grub` with the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX option (`GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="psmouse.proto=bare quiet splash`)

3) As root run `sudo update-grub`

4) Create /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/11-trackpoint-wheel-emulation.conf

5) Reboot

Don't forget to disable your touchpad in the bios to avoid the cursor wobbling when you click!
