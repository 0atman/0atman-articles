Title: Remove Slack's Sidebar

I've recently started using Slack, and I really like it, but the unhidable sidebar has been getting me down. Turns out it's simple to hide it using this CSS snippet:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/0atman/f7010a29ec02d3ebdd9c.js"></script>

Credit to [Robin](https://github.com/nottrobin) for most of the code, I just tweaked it a bit.

You can get this working with an extension like [Stylish](https://userstyles.org/stylish) or your favourite userstyles plugin!
