Title: An open letter to my MP, Simon Hughes

Thank you for taking the time to explain the bill to me. I am afraid to say that I am unsatisfied by your defence of the bill.

You say that the ECJ ruled the existing law illegal, so what we in the UK need is an emergency, temporary provision to cover this case.

Let me quote the ECJ ruling, 
"The Court takes the view that, by requiring the retention of those data and by allowing the competent national authorities to access those data, **the directive interferes in a particularly serious manner with the fundamental rights to respect for private life** and to the protection of personal data. Furthermore, the fact that data are retained and subsequently used without the subscriber or registered user being informed is **likely to generate in the persons concerned a feeling that their private lives are the subject of constant surveillance**." [emphasis mine]

Please explain, how DRIP is anything but a circumvention of the ECJ's ruling, violating our rights to a private life?
Expiration in 2016 does not reassure me, I do not want my private life to be spied on by my government for one day, not one second.

I am very concerned,

Tristram Oaten
