Title: Necessity is The Mother Of Invention

Cast your mind back to Easter 2002. I was at the tender age of 16, and discovering all sorts of exciting things about the world, such as this Linux thing everyone was telling me to learn.

My family went on a SCUBA diving holiday to Hurghada, on the Red Sea in Egypt.

Day 1: drank tap water

All I had was a laptop with a fresh install of Slackware Linux on

No apps, only what came on the 8 disks.

All week I tried to get to grips with this alien system.

I read man pages and played around with the terminal, I remember not knowing the difference between a single dot meaning _current directory_ and two dots meaning _previous directory_.

Slowly, over the course of my forcable solitude I broke through the barrier to greatness that we all must get through: I understood the command line.

By the end of the holiday, I hadn't seen the pyramids, the nile, or any Egyption sights. But I *had* unlocked one of the wonders of the modern world: Linux.

And the rest is history.
