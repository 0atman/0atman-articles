**The European Union's importance is simple and profound, in a way that people have forgotten.**


 - It's not about improving trade ([though it does](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/3748166e-3151-11e6-ad39-3fee5ffe5b5b.html)).
 - Its not about upholding universal human rights ([though it does](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights)).
 - Nor is it about standing up to international corporate amorality ([though it does](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/16/business/international/european-union-google-antitrust-case.html?_r=0))

The European Union was created, quite simply, [to prevent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union#History) the atrocities of WW2 happening again.
It is difficult to imagine the term _"to stop WW3"_ used without hyperbole, but this is one of the few cases where it can, **and must** be.
