So imagine you're me.sidenote '' "Stop crying"%} Now imagine you've accidentally removed yourself from the sudo groupsidenote '' "Docker's fault"%}.

_"No problem"_, you might reasonably think, _I'll just reboot into a root shell and fix that"._

Not so fast, hotshot. Your fancy Surface Go has EFI, which means the GRUB menu doesn't show, and this machine has a bug that doesn't initialise the keyboard until after Ubuntu starts booting. This means pressing escape or holding shift, doesn't bring up the GRUB menu to boot into single-user mode.

_"OK, can we boot the drive in another machine?"_

Great question: It's superglued on to the motherboard. This is, effectively, a tablet.

_"FSCK IT I'll REINSTALL LINUX"_, you might reasonably exclaim.

I've got news for you, it's stopped booting from USB for unknown, spooky, EFI reasons.

**No reinstall, no single-user mode, no sudo**

I despaired for a month before realising I now work in the Cybersecurity department of the Government Digital Service. So, the next day, I talked to one of our ethical hackers, and after 30 minutes of searching, we used a 0-daysidenote '' "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47163" %} to get me root.
Which, after a quick bit of C++ compiling, was SO EASY:

After that, it was a simple matter to restore my membership in the `sudo` group and get back up and running with my little Linux tablet.

The whole matter has opened my eyes to just how trivial _privilege escalation_ can be, even with a very modern, patched system.
