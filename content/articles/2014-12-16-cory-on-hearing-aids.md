If you’re my age and grew up with the Walkman or you’re little younger and you grow up with the iPod, you will have logged enough punishing earbud hours that by the time you reach a certain age you will almost certainly need a hearing aid

It is vanishingly unlikely that that hearing aid will be a retro, beige, hipster, analog transistor hearing aid.

Instead it will be a computer that you put in your body and, depending on how it works, it can:

1) Make you hear things that aren’t there

2) Make you not hear things that are there

3) Tell other people what you’ve heard

**We’ve got to get this right**
