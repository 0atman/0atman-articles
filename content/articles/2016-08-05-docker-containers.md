Software containers have, almost overnight, made traditional piecemeal-deployment processes obsolete in the same way as the physical shipping container did for traditional crate-based shipping.

Just because you *can* write and ship software without using containers, doesn't mean you *should*.

Just as we don't have to chose to use processes, it's just how we run code on an OS, there is no longer a need to choose containers, it's just how we do things now. That all systems will use containers in the future is certainly inevitable, it is a revolutionary way of thinking in the same way that the UNIX process model was.

Maybe your current architecture doesn't lend itself to containerisation - your current architecture is now wrong.
Maybe you are running on platform that doesn't support containers - your platform is now obsolete.
Maybe you're just one developer hacking together something experimental on your own machine - you are only hurting you own productivity.

Container-based solutions will eat everything, and it is right that they should.
