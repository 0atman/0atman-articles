I'm Tris. I'm an producer, web developer, and musician based in London. I write [electronic music](https://namtao.com), [fast technical videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/NoBoilerplate), produce an urban fantasy podcast called [Modem Prometheus](https://www.modemprometheus.com/), and a hopepunk podcast called [Lost Terminal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3bDE9kszMc&list=PL95NP4bDITAln7fq-cCqzOFE15UvVthuL&index=2&t=0s), exploring themes of near-future AI which blends my three great passions of music, programming, and ~~love of my own voice~~ writing fiction!
